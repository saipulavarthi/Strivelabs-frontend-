# Country Explorer

**Country Explorer** is a web application that allows users to explore information about countries worldwide. It offers features like keyword search, filtering by region or language, a favorites section, and detailed country views.

```

```

### Open the Project in VS Code:

### Design Decisions
Filter Logic:
The app supports combined filtering by region and language for more refined results.

Search and Filter Integration:
Users can search for countries by name, with real-time updates. Filters work alongside the search to narrow down results.

Favorite System:
Users can mark countries as favorites, toggled via heart icons (‚ù§Ô∏è/ü§ç). Favorites are saved in localStorage and displayed in an overlay for easy management.
---------------------


### Manual Testing:
Open the app in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
Verify the following:

-Search: Search functionality dynamically updates results based on input.
-Filters: Combined filters for region and language accurately refine the displayed countries.
-Favorites: Adding/removing countries as favorites updates the heart icon and persists in localStorage.
-Navigation: Clicking on a country card renders detailed information in the same tab.
-Load More: The "Load More" button fetches and displays additional countries seamlessly.


----------------------

### Search:
-Type in the search bar to find countries by name.
-The search dynamically displays suggestions. The "View All" option displays all matches as cards.
-Filters can be applied alongside the search to refine results further.
### Filters:
-Filter countries by region (e.g., Africa, Europe) and language (e.g., English, French).
-Both filters can be applied simultaneously or independently.
-Filtered results dynamically update based on the search query.

------------------------


### Favorites:
-Mark countries as favorites.
-The favorites are saved in localStorage and persist across sessions.
-Favorites are displayed under the heart symbol at the top of the page for easy access.
---------------------------

### Country Details:
-Clicking a country card opens a detailed view with:

-Flag
-Capital
-Population
-Languages
-Region
-Area
-A "Back" link to return to the homepage without losing the original results.
-----------------------------------------
